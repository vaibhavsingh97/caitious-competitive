# Testcase Example:  '[1,3]\n[2]'
#
# There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
#
# Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity
# should be O(log (m+n)).
#
# You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# nums1 = [1, 3]
# nums2 = [2]
#
# The median is 2.0
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# nums1 = [1, 2]
# nums2 = [3, 4]
#
# The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
#

class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:
        s = nums1 + nums2
        return float(statistics.median(s))
